From the "Load" window on the left-hand side click "Load C3Ds...".

Click "Theia3d Builder". 

Change the following settings:
- File Tags = Session
- Primary Data Folder = Session
- Theia3D Session Folder Mask = *
- Theia3D File Mask = *pose_filt_*.c3d
- Leave all other settings as default or blank

Click "Create CMZs"

This will create a CMZ library consisting of one workspace (CMZ) per subject that contains one C3D file. That C3D file will be the filtered version of the pose estimation from Theia.
